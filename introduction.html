                <p>This website is designed to allow people to see more visually the changes in water quality from year to year.</p>
                I chose the same sample, 1S07, on the first day of different months in different years. 
Multiple use of the same individual overcomes the variability between individuals. At the same time, there is no need to spend too much time and effort on the problem of sample size.
<p>People can compare the data to see how good or bad the water quality is and how it changes.</p>
<p>Each year has a different number of vials on the corresponding page.
    The change in quantity corresponds to the absence of data.</p>
