    <h3>Residual free chlorine</h3>
    <h4>The amount of chlorine available at the end of a specified contact period in chlorinated water or wastewater. This residual may be in the form of dissolved gas (Cl2), hypochlorous acid (HOCl), or hypochlorite ion (OClâ€“), but does not include chlorine combined with an amine (ammonia or nitrogen) or other organic compound.
        The presence of chlorine residual in drinking water indicates that: 1) a sufficient amount of chlorine was added initially to the water to inactivate the bacteria and some viruses that cause diarrheal disease; and, 2) the water is protected from recontamination during storage.</h4>
